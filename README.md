# RAG System - Project

## üéØ Project Context & Requirements

This project was developed as part of a technical interview for an AI Engineer position. The challenge was to build an intelligent technical support system with personalized recommendations for a freelance platform.

### Original Requirements:
- **RAG Query Service**: Answer technical questions with <5 second response time
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest relevant resources based on user history
- **Out-of-scope Detection**: Handle queries outside the platform domain
- **Source Attribution**: Provide references to original documentation
- **Performance Metrics**: Track system performance and user engagement

## üß† Development Process & Decision Rationale

### Phase 1: Architecture Planning

**Why I chose this approach:**
When approaching this RAG system, I needed to balance demonstration value with production readiness. The key was to show deep understanding of RAG principles while keeping the implementation clean and explainable for an interview setting.

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

1. **In-Memory Vector Store vs External Database**
   - **Decision**: Custom in-memory implementation
   - **Reasoning**: For an interview demo, I wanted to show I understand the core concepts without getting bogged down in infrastructure setup
   - **Trade-off**: Less scalable but more transparent and easier to debug
   - **Production Note**: Would use Pinecone/Weaviate in real deployment

2. **Document Structure Design**
   ```python
   @dataclass
   class Document:
       id: str
       title: str
       content: str
       category: str
       tags: List[str]
       url: Optional[str]
       last_updated: datetime
   ```
   - **Why dataclasses**: Type safety, automatic methods, clean code
   - **Why these fields**: Each field serves a specific purpose in retrieval and personalization
   - **Categories**: Enable domain-specific routing and user preference tracking

### Phase 2: Knowledge Base Creation

**Strategic Decision**: I created 8 comprehensive mock documents covering different aspects of the Shakers platform.

**Why this approach:**
- **Demonstration Value**: Shows I can create realistic, comprehensive documentation
- **Diversity**: Covers multiple domains (payments, security, development, etc.)
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Includes edge cases like Android development requests
- **Interview Context**: Easy to understand and evaluate during presentation

**Document Categories Created:**
1. **Platform Overview** - General introduction
2. **Payment System** - Core business logic
3. **Freelancer Profiles** - User management
4. **Client Onboarding** - Business process
5. **Android Development** - Specific service offering
6. **Project Management** - Tool capabilities
7. **Security & Privacy** - Compliance aspects
8. **Support Procedures** - Operational processes

### Phase 3: Vector Store Implementation

**Technical Decision**: Custom VectorStore class with numpy-based similarity search

```python
class VectorStore:
    def __init__(self):
        self.documents: List[VectorDocument] = []
        self.embeddings_matrix: Optional[np.ndarray] = None
```

**Why this design:**
- **Educational Value**: Shows I understand vector operations at a low level
- **Performance**: NumPy operations are highly optimized
- **Transparency**: Easy to debug and explain during interview
- **Flexibility**: Can easily modify similarity algorithms

**Embedding Strategy Decision:**
- **Model**: OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`
- **Dimensions**: 1536 (good balance of quality vs cost)
- **Normalization**: L2 normalization for consistent similarity scores
- **Why OpenAI**: State-of-the-art quality, consistent with LLM model

### Phase 4: RAG Query Service

**Core Design Philosophy**: Multi-stage pipeline with clear separation of concerns

```python
class RAGQueryService:
    def query(self, user_query: str) -> QueryResult:
        # 1. Classify scope
        # 2. Retrieve documents  
        # 3. Generate response
        # 4. Calculate confidence
```

**Why this pipeline approach:**
- **Modularity**: Each step can be tested and optimized independently
- **Debugging**: Easy to identify where issues occur
- **Interview Value**: Shows systematic thinking and clean architecture
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new features or modify existing ones

**Query Classification Decision:**
- **Approach**: LLM-based classification with structured JSON output
- **Why LLM**: More flexible than rule-based systems, handles edge cases
- **Why Structured**: Ensures consistent parsing and error handling
- **Domains**: Predefined list enables better routing and analytics

### Phase 5: Personalization Engine

**Key Innovation**: Multi-factor recommendation scoring system

```python
def generate_recommendations(self, user_id: str, query: str, top_k: int = 3):
    # Category preference score (40%)
    score += category_score * 0.4
    # Content similarity score (30%) 
    score += similarity * 0.3
    # Historical interaction score (20%)
    score += interaction_score * 0.2
    # Recency bonus (10%)
    score += recency_score * 0.1
```

**Why this scoring approach:**
- **Balanced**: No single factor dominates recommendations
- **Explainable**: Each recommendation has clear reasoning
- **Learning**: System improves with user interactions
- **Interview Value**: Shows understanding of recommendation systems

**User Profile Design:**
```python
@dataclass
class UserProfile:
    user_id: str
    query_history: List[str]
    category_preferences: Dict[str, float]
    document_interactions: Dict[str, int]
```

**Why these fields:**
- **Query History**: Enables pattern analysis
- **Category Preferences**: Tracks user interests over time
- **Document Interactions**: Enables collaborative filtering concepts
- **Timestamps**: Support recency-based recommendations

### Phase 6: Metrics & Monitoring

**Design Decision**: Comprehensive metrics dashboard with visualizations

**Why this approach:**
- **Production Mindset**: Shows I think about observability
- **Business Value**: Metrics drive product decisions
- **Interview Value**: Demonstrates full-stack thinking
- **Debugging**: Essential for system optimization

**Metrics Tracked:**
- Response times (performance requirement)
- Success rates (quality measurement)
- Domain distribution (usage patterns)
- User engagement (product insights)

**Reasoning:**
- **Prevents Overfitting**: No single signal dominates
- **Explainable**: Each recommendation has clear reasoning
- **Balanced**: Accounts for different user behaviors
- **Tunable**: Weights can be adjusted based on data

### Why Structured Prompts?

**Decision**: XML-based prompt templates with structured output

**Reasoning:**
